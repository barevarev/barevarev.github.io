            <p class="profile-bio">One thing everyone knows about me is that I love traveling, but I will talk about it in a bit. Except traveling, I love playing music. I learned how to play the guitar by myself when I was 12, and continued exploring other multiple instruments, played in the school band, and now I am trying to become a dj. I have many different interests that I could talk about endlessly, but since I gave a quick introduction of myself, youâ€™re welcome to contact me and learn more.
